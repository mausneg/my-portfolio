Machine Learning Engineer specializing in Computer Vision and LLM-based systems with production deployment experience. Improved 10% accuracy (76% to 86%) on ear disease classification with fine tuning Google Vision Transformer Base Model with 200–300 ms/image CPU inference via FastAPI & Docker. Built an on-device TFJS YOLOv5n detector and Ministral-3 (Ollama) LLM extractor, got ~15–27 s/image OCR inference on GPU server with structured Pydantic output and hierarchical region normalization. This system improved accuracy and reliability over contour-based cropping + EasyOCR.Experienced in MLOps automation with Airflow, MLflow, and Docker, reducing manual workload by ~80%. TensorFlow Developer Certified with strong foundations in deep learning, model optimization, and end-to-end ML system design.
