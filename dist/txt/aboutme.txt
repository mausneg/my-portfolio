Machine Learning Engineer with end-to-end expertise in designing, training, and deploying AI solutions. Experienced in developing an ENT diagnosis model using private clinical data with Hugging Face Transformers (PyTorch), boosting ear-disease classification accuracy from 77% to 81%, and building GAN-based image enhancement models with TensorFlow (PSNR 26, SSIM 0.80). Skilled in constructing AI pipelines with Airflow, MLflow, MinIO, and Docker, cutting manual workload by 80% across training and deployment. Integrated models into real-time applications, including a Tkinter desktop app with optimized image capture (24 FPS, up from 5 FPS), and enhanced security through GPS-based data acquisition and dongle-based access control. Strong foundation in databases, software engineering, and academic contributions through hands-on ML teaching materials (KNN, SVM, Random Forest).
