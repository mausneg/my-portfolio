Hello, I'm Maulana Surya Negara, a fifth-semester Informatic Engineering student at Mataram University, born on March 19, 2003, in Mataram, West Nusa Tenggara. I'm passionate about web development and machine learning.
My interest in web development sparked during a university web programming course. I've since dived into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through online tutorials and courses on platforms like Dicoding, eager to create engaging web applications.
Simultaneously, I've started exploring machine learning through independent studies in the Bangkit Machine Learning program, focusing on TensorFlow and deep learning.
I've successfully completed various web development projects, both personal and coursework-related, and I'm excited to kick off my first machine learning project.
My goal is to deepen my expertise in both areas and contribute to innovative technology by merging web development with artificial intelligence.
Beyond tech, I enjoy jogging, playing chess, and relish in adventurous activities like mountain hiking.
